This repository contains a simple TypeScript function that demonstrates a common type error. The function `greet` takes two parameters, a string representing a person's name and a Date object representing the current date.  The function logs a greeting message to the console and returns the same message as a string. The bug is in the function signature where the second parameter is incorrectly typed as a string instead of Date. This leads to a type error when the function is called with a string argument. The solution shows how to correct the type annotation for the second parameter to `Date`, fixing the type error.
